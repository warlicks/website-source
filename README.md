## Website Source Code
This repository contains the source code for [my personal website](www.seanwarlick.com).

## Colophon   
SeanWarlick.com built using the combination of the [Hugo]() framework and the R package [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown).  It utilizes the [future imperfect theme](https://github.com/jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect), which is licensed under the MIT license.  The site is built by and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).  
  
Posts are written in a combination of Markdown and Rmarkdown. For basic posts I tend to use Markdown, which Hugo can render natively.  In cases where I would like to include R code and the output of the code I use Rmarkdown.  **blogdown** renders the Rmarkdown file to HTML, which is then servered by the Hugo framework.
