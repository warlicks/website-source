## Data Science Experience  
**Boeing**, *Seattle, WA*, January 2016 - Present

* Team lead for project to model failures in airplane engines using general additive models to identify operational behaviors and environmental conditions associated to the failures. Model results were used to provide airline specific recommendations for modifying take off and climb procedures to extend engine life.  
* Developed two predictive maintenance alerts and two diagnostic alerts using multiple sources of aircraft sensor data. These alerts have led to reductions in unscheduled maintenance and part replacements saving more than half a million dollars in 2018.  
* Contributed to building the computing system, processes and tools used by the alerting and prognostic team to deploy more than 10 predictive maintenance alerts to multiple airline customers in less than six months.  
* Developed a system utilizing R and R Markdown to automate the delivery of custom aircraft status reports to airline maintenance crews at the arrival airport within one hour of departure, reducing time between flights.  
* Collaborated with an engineering team to build a dashboard suite for evaluating aircraft part reliability over time, eliminating reliance on external teams and suppliers by integrating and visualizing data from four databases.  
* Built and maintain a data extraction pipeline for proprietary XML documents that are the primary source for a tool allowing airlines to evaluate 12000 available aircraft modifications.  

**Airlines Reporting Corporation**, *Arlington, VA*,   May 2013 - January 2016 

* Designed and carried out research projects on a variety of topics relevant to the airline industry that gained widespread media coverage. Notable reports include a 2014 covered by the [Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/life/travel/best-times-to-buy-airline-tickets/) and [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Travel/turns-sundays-best-day-buy-airfare/story?id=26422898).  
* Collaborated with Expedia to provide analysis featured in [Travel Check-Up: Air Travel Trends 2015](https://viewfinder.expedia.com/img/ARC_Half_Year_Data_Study_FINAL_060815.pdf?mcicid=social.vf) and [Preparing for Take-Off: Air Travel Outlook for 2016](https://viewfinder.expedia.com/img/HLG-ARC-Booklet.pdf).
* Built a dashboard suite to assist destination-marketing clients in making business decisions.  
* Developed predictive models to inform staffing decisions at airport retail locations.  
* Used topic modeling and sentiment analysis to automate the evaluation of customer comments in an annual satisfaction survey.  

**Data Kind DC**, *Washington, DC*   2015  

* Participated in development of interactive of labor violations for the Fair Labor Association  
* Collaborated with other data scientists using different programming languages and with different areas of expertise  
* Contributed time and skills to data projects for local non-profits
