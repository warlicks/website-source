Sean Warlick is a Data Scientist working in the airline and aerospace industry.  He currently works in for Boeing in their globla services division.  Previously, Sean worked on airline ticking data with the Airlines Reporting Corporation.  In these roles worked on a variety of projects that have utilized his skills in dashboard development, predictive modeling, time series modeling, and natural language processing.   
 
Sean is a giant nerd who enjoys working with cool data sets and answering interesting questions.  R is his favorite tool for answering interesting questions.  He has been slowly adding Python to his tool kit, particularly for working with text.  
 
When not in front of a computer Sean takes full advantage of all that the Pacific Northwest has to offer.  He enjoys hiking, backpacking, skiing and mountain biking.  Someday, he would like to ski 100 days in a year.  If he's had a few too many of his own home-brews, he thinks about opening a brewery.
