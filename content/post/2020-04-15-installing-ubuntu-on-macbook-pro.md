Trapped at home, I've been slowly making my way through chores I've been putting off. One of the things I put off is performing a full install of my operating system on my aging Mac Book Pro. At nearly 10 years old, it is starting to show its age. It is stuck on macOS High Sierra, which Apple will end support later this year.

Rather than get stuck with an unsupported operating system, I decided to switch my operating system to Linux. I've been planning to make this move for a little while so, spent a time using [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop), [Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/) and [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) in VMs. While I preferred the look and feel of Mint, I ultimately selected Ubuntu as my distro. The strong support system that has developed out Ubuntu's popularity is hard to beat. 

Having settled on Ubuntu I spent a day preparing for the switch. Most of my files live in Dropbox or Google Drive so I didn't have to spend a lot of time copying files to an external drive. All of my files would just sync after installing the appropriate software. 

While the files in cloud storage would just appear, all of the photos I've accumulated in a decade plus as a Mac users wouldn't. All of them were stored in Apple's Photos library. Fortunately, Photos made it was easy to export the originals to an external hard drive. 

With all of my files prepared it was time to make the switch. I ran one last Time Machine backup, just in case, and [created a bootable installer](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#1-overview). With a final restart of my computer I said good bye to MacOS.

Once Ubuntu was installed on my laptop it only took me a couple of hours to copy my photos, sync my files and install all the software I needed. I replaced Thunder Bird with Mailspring for email. I installed [Ao](https://klaussinani.tech/ao/) to interface with Microsoft To-Do. The usual suspects of R, RStudio, Anaconda, VS Code and Docker also found their way on to my machine.

I've been operating my "new" computer for a couple of days now and I can't really say I've noticed a difference. Sure thing look a little different and I'm learning new interaction patterns, but really it's still just a computer.
