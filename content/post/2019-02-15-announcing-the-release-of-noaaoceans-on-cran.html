<p>I’m excited to announce that my first R package, <strong>noaaoceans</strong>, is now available on CRAN. The current version focuses on accessing data from the <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/">CO-OPS API</a>. The package also facilitates the collection of basic metadata for each of the stations that collect the data available in the API.</p>
<div id="installation" class="section level2">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The package can be installed from CRAN or GitHub.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Install from CRAN
install.packages(&#39;noaaoceans&#39;)

# Install from GitHub
remotes::install_github(&#39;warlicks/noaaoceans&#39;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There are two functions included in the package and they are often used together to provide the information of interest. The first function in the package is <code>list_coops_stations()</code>, which allows users to find metadata about each NOAA data collection station. Each time the function is called, it gathers the data from NOAA’s website, so the station metadata and the status of its sensors is always up-to-date. The other function in the package is <code>query_coops_data()</code>. This function allows the user to specify a location, data type, and time period of interest. For details on the types of data available, see the <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/">CO-OPS API Documentation</a>.</p>
<p>In developing the <strong>noaaoceans</strong> package I have tried to make the package as user-friendly as possible. Both functions return a data frame. I feel that the typical R user is most familiar with this data structure and allows the user to immediately use the popular tools in the <strong>tideyverse</strong> to assist in their analysis. In the remainder of this article I will take the reader through an example using the package to collect and visualize water temperature data for locations in the state of Washington.</p>
</div>
<div id="examples" class="section level2">
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>In the example below we start by loading the <strong>noaaoceans</strong> package and supporting packages <strong>dplyr</strong> and <strong>ggplot2</strong>. The <strong>maps</strong> and <strong>mapsdata</strong> packages will be used in the second example. Calling <code>list_coops_stations()</code> returns a data frame with metadata for each of NOAA’s measurement stations.</p>

<p>The returned data frame has a total of 15 columns. The first several columns identify the station and provide its geographic location. The remaining columns indicate the status of the of the sensors at each station. In these columns a <em>1</em> indicates the sensor is working, while a <em>0</em> indicates the sensor is not working. A <code>NA</code> indicates that that particular sensor does not exist at the given station.</p>
<p>After taking a look at the data returned by <code>list_coops_stations()</code>, it’s time to identify our stations of interest. In this case I want to find all stations in the state of Washington (WA) that collect water temperature. This is accomplished by simply filtering the data frame with <code>dplyr::filter()</code> and the appropriate logic.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Filter to stations in Washington with Water Temp Sensor
wa_station &lt;- station_df %&gt;% 
    filter(station_state == &#39;WA&#39; &amp; water_temp == &#39;1&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>The results of filtering returns a data frame with records for 10 locations that meet the specified criteria. The data from the <em>station_id</em> column will be used when querying the API with <code>query_coops_data()</code>. Via the API we’ll capture hourly water temperatures for each station in December 2018. We’ll pass each of these conditions as an argument to the function. For a complete list of arguments see the help documentation <code>help(query_coops_data)</code>. The details and options available to each argument are covered in the <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/">CO-OPS API Documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The API only allows the user to pass a single location at time. To collect data for each station in Washington I loop through our vector of <em>station_id</em>s and update the <code>station_id =</code> argument in <code>query_coops_data</code>. Each call returns a data frame which will be concatenated to a storage data frame to create a full set of water temperature data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create an empty storage data frame. 
water_temp &lt;- data.frame()

# Loop through the station and call the API for each station
for (i in wa_station$station_id) {
    query_df &lt;- query_coops_data(station_id = i,
                                 start_date = &#39;20181201&#39;,

                                 data_product = &#39;water_temperature&#39;,
                                 interval = &#39;h&#39;) # hourly readings

<p>Now that we have our data, we’ll start by plotting the average hourly water temperature in Washington. Before I can do that I need to make a few data type corrections. Both our time stamp value (<em>t</em>) and the water temperature (<em>v</em>) are returned as character strings. These will be converted to POSIXct and numeric respectively.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Correct data types. 
water_temp &lt;- water_temp %&gt;% 
    mutate(v = as.numeric(v), t = as.POSIXct(t))

water_temp %&gt;% 
    group_by(t) %&gt;% 
    # Compute the hourly average. 
    summarise(avg_temp = mean(v, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% 
    # Plot the hourly average. 
    ggplot(aes(x = t, y = avg_temp)) +
    geom_path() +
    labs(x = &quot;Date&quot;,
         y = &#39;Average Water Temperature&#39;,

<p>As one might expect the average hourly temperature decreases over the month as winter sets in. There is a steady decrease over the first ten days, before the temperature rises again and holds fairly steady after the middle of the month. There appears to be a daily pattern where the temperature drops at night and increases during the day.</p>
<p>One consequence of finding the hourly average is that we have hidden any geographic effects. There might be temperature differences at each station. A map with each station and the average temperature at that station will help study this. We will need to combine the water temperature data with the station meta data to accomplish this task.</p>

<p>After looking at some basic examples of using <strong>noaaoceans</strong> we should highlight a known issue with the <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/">CO-OPS API</a>. While developing the package we encountered a few occasions where the data inventory indicates that data exist for a given time period, but it isn’t available via the API.</p>
<p>A specific example as of this this writing is the Neah Bay (Station ID: 9443090). The station’s <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/inventory.html?id=9443090">data inventory</a> indicates that water temperature is available for all of 2018. However, when querying the API the data for January and February 2018 isn’t available.</p>
<p>Depending on the date requested in the API call, the API handles this problem in different ways. When setting the date range for only the missing period, the API response includes an error indicating that no data was found.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>neah_bay_january &lt;- query_coops_data(station_id = &#39;9443090&#39;,
                                     start_date = &#39;20180101&#39;,
                                     end_date = &#39;20180228&#39;,
                                     data_product = &#39;water_temperature&#39;,
                                     interval = &#39;h&#39;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Error in query_coops_data(station_id = &quot;9443090&quot;, start_date = &quot;20180101&quot;, : No data was found. This product may not be offered at this station at the requested time.</code></pre>
<p>When querying the API for the Neah Bay station and request all of 2018 an error is not included in the response. The expected data frame is returned.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>neah_bay_year &lt;- query_coops_data(station_id = &#39;9443090&#39;,
                                     start_date = &#39;20180101&#39;,
                                     end_date = &#39;20181231&#39;,
                                     data_product = &#39;water_temperature&#39;,
                                     interval = &#39;h&#39;)

<p>A quick inspection of the returned data frame shows that the temperature value (<em>v</em>) is missing for the January and February time stamps. In summary if you query for a period where there is only missing data you’ll get an error. If you submit a query for a date range and a subset of that period is missing data will be returned with missing values for the appropriate dates.</p>
<p>If you encounter a situation where it appears that data should be available for a given query, you might want to contact NOAA’s User Services(<a href="mailto:co-ops.userservices@noaa.gov">co-ops.userservices@noaa.gov</a>). They have been very responsive, when issues have been raised and worked to get the missing data accessible if the data is in their database.</p>
<p>Building my first R package has been a fun and a good learning experience. I plan to continuing to develop the package. Please feel free to open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/warlicks/noaaoceans/issues/">GitHub</a> if you find any bugs or would like to request a feature.</p>
